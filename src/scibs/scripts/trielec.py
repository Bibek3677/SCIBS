    The eps-snap in Phase 1 only looks at a single edge's own crossing
    fraction; when a triangle has two boundary-crossing edges that each miss
    the snap threshold by a little, the corner they cut off can still be a
    near-degenerate sliver. This does a real topological edge collapse (merge
    the sliver's shortest edge, drop any face that becomes degenerate as a
    result) rather than just relocating a vertex, since nudging a vertex that
    is shared by several other triangles tends to turn *those* into new
    slivers instead of actually removing the bad one.

    Vertices that sit on an electrode-boundary label transition are exactly
    where Phase 1 placed them on the electrode's true circular boundary, so
    merging one into an *interior* (non-boundary) vertex would drag a point of
    that boundary inward and dent the circle right after we fixed it to be
    round -- edges that would do that are skipped. The classic sliver shape is
    actually two *adjacent* boundary vertices (both crossing points landing
    near the same mesh corner) plus one interior vertex, so boundary-boundary
    edges stay collapsible: merging two already-near-coincident points on the
    same curve doesn't move the boundary in any meaningful sense. If a sliver
    has no boundary-safe edge at all, it's left alone rather than distorting
    the boundary to remove it.
